## **What it is**:

Flaviozanoni.com is a personal website designed to be an OS inside your browser, it hosts my resume and some projects I`ve worked on, but it's also a playground for me to test new technologies and ideas. The website is designed to be a fun and interactive experience, with a desktop-like interface, complete with draggable windows, a start menu, and a bottom bar with the time and links to my social media. You can also delete any files upload an wallpaper, make files and make it "yours", all the state is saved in the local storage, so you can come back and everything will be as you left it.

## **Why**:

I've always wanted to create a game portfolio, but it didn't align with all the technologies I work with. So, I thought, why not create an old OS-like website that could accommodate all my needs? The project is developed primarily for fun, and while the first iteration of each feature might not follow best practices or have the most optimized code, I plan to refactor and improve the code in subsequent iterations. The base of the project is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), which allows me to experiment with any framework I want to test, like React, Preact, Svelte, etc. The core "OS" part of the project is made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) because I wanted to learn it and I think it's a great framework.

## **Technologies I`ve used in the refactor**:

- \- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- \- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- \- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- \- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
