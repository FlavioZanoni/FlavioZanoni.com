## **What it is**:

p2pdirectlink is a web app made to help people to share files with each other through webRTC, all completely peer to peer and anonymous, without the need to create an account. Users can simply access the website, send a link to the recipient, and start the transfer.

## **Why**:

I once was watching a video of [Kyle Young](https://www.youtube.com/@kylerobinsonyoung) about webRTC an thought to myself, this is pretty cool, I should make something with this, so, as I was just starting to learn about programming I thought it would be a cool project to learn more web development, took a while but there it was, a working prototype of p2pdirectlink, later I decided to refactor and make it a real useful website, but I still have to finish it.

## **Technologies Iâ€™ve used in the refactor**:

- \- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- \- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
- \- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- \- [Reactjs](https://react.dev/)
- \- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
