## **What it is**:

p2pdirectlink is an web app made to help people to share files with each others through webRTC, all completely peer to peer and anonymous, without the need to create an account, the user would just access the website, send the link to the other person to start the transfer.

## **Why**:

I once was watching a video of [Kyle Young](https://www.youtube.com/@kylerobinsonyoung) about webRTC an tought to myself, this is pretty cool, I should make something with this, so, as I was just starting to learn about programming I thought it would be a cool project to learn more web development, took a while but there it was, a working prototype of p2pdirectlink, later I decided to refactor and make it a real usefull website, but I still have to finish it.

## **Technologies I`ve used in the refactor**:

- \- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- \- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
- \- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- \- [Reactjs](https://react.dev/)
- \- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
