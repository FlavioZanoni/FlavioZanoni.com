## **What it is**:

Defenser is a web app focused on the field of precision agriculture, the app is designed for farmers to keep track of the application of inputs in their crops and generate reports of the application of these inputs, as well as to keep track of inputs made by the workers in the field, helping to keep track and analize the data, bringing more control and efficiency to this process.

## **Why**:

The app was first conceived when me and my team were working on a project for a the 2023 Show Rural Hackathon, we were given some problems, an this one stood out of the others, we conducted an interview and analyze the requirements with the problem owner, then with her aproval we started to work on the project, we were able to deliver a working prototype in 40 hours, and we won 3rd place, after that we decided to keep working on the project and make it a real product.
