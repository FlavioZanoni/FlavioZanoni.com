## **What it is**:

Defenser is a web app focused on precision agriculture. It is designed to help farmers track the application of inputs in their crops and generate reports on these activities. Additionally, it monitors inputs applied by workers in the field, enabling better data analysis and enhancing control and efficiency in the process.

## **Why**:

The app was initially conceived when my team and I were working on a project for the 2023 Show Rural Hackathon. We were presented with several problems, and this one stood out. We conducted an interview and analyzed the requirements with the problem owner. With her approval, we began working on the project. We delivered a working prototype in 40 hours and won 3rd place. After that, we decided to continue developing the project and turn it into a real product.
