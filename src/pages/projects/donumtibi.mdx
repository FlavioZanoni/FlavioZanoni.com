## **What it is**:

The app is basically an STL file viewer, where you can upload an STL file and visualize it in 3D, you can rotate, zoom in and out, and see the object from different angles and based on the volume of the object I can calculate how much would it cost to print it in a 3D printer.

## **Why**:

I once had a 3D printer and was selling some prints, but for each person that wanted a quotation i needed to download the .stl plug it in the software then make the calculation, so I automated the process and made a web app that does this for me, now I just need to send the link to the person and they can see the object and the price. (I sold the 3D printer so i hosted it in github pages and removed the server side code)
