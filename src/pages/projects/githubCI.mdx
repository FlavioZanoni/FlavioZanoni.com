## **What it is**:

This is one of the first projects I made when I was learning programming, its a simple "CI" integration with the github API that detects the when some code was pushed to the repository and then it deploys the code to a self hosted server.

## **Why**:

there was an issue in the company that i was working that they had to manually deploy the code to their self hosted server, and now we were using github to manage the code, so I thought it would be a good idea to make a simple CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
