Motive: Need a website to be my resume and portifolio, allways wanted to make a game portifolio, but it does not match with all the tecnologies that I work on, so why not make a old OS like website with folders and files that link to my projects and resume, as well as games if I want to make any

TODO:

- homescreen:
  - html-droppable slots for the "icons"
  - bottom bar with the start menu, hour, and chevron drawer with the linkedin and github icons

- virtual state:
  - the virtual state should have the default state and can be modified on the fly by the user (he can make watherver he wants, (move and delete files))
