## Motivation

Needed a website to be my resume and portfolio, always wanted to make a game portfolio, but it does not match with all the technologies that I work on, so why not make a old OS like website with folders and files that link to my projects and resume, as well as games if I want to make any

## Disclaimer

```plaintext
This project is being developed only for fun.
I, generally, in the first iteration of the feature, will not be using the best practices nor the most optimized code,
but I will be refactoring the code in the next iterations as I see fit.
Every feature can change at anytime and change any other parts of the code.
```

## Description

- This project is an "operating system", designed to host my projects, resume, and a playground for me to test new technologies and ideas.
- The base of the project is made with [Astro](https://astro.build) witch will allow me try out any framework that I want to test, like React, Preact, Svelte, etc.
- The core "OS" part of the project is made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) just because I wanted to learn it, and i think it's a great framework.

## Roadmap

A very basic feature/bugs planning can be found [here](https://github.com/FlavioZanoni/FlavioZanoni.com/blob/main/todo.md)
